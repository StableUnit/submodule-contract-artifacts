Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be\\n * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in\\n * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.\\n *\\n * For example:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```solidity\\n * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {\\n *     function initialize() initializer public {\\n *         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n *\\n * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {\\n *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {\\n *         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");\\n *     }\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy.

The second is that because permits have\\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\\n * generally recommended is:\\n *\\n * ```solidity\\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\\n *     doThing(..., value);\\n * }\\n *\\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\\n *     ...\\n * }\\n * ```\\n *\\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\\n *\\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\\n */\\ninterface IERC20Permit {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\\n     *\\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\\n     * ordering also apply here.\\n     *\\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\\n     *\\n     * Requirements:\\n     *\\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\\n     *\\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\\n     * section].\\n     *\\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\\n     */\\n    function permit(\\n        address owner,\\n        address spender,\\n        uint256 value,\\n        uint256 deadline,\\n        uint8 v,\\n        bytes32 r,\\n        bytes32 s\\n    ) external;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
